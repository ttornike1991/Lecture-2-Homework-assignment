## Main task 

Create an animation using HTML and CSS that reproduces the "screensaver" effect of an old DVD player, where a logo smoothly moves across the screen, bounces off the edge, and changes color.

The animation should repeat infinitely and be synchronized with a sound effect.
The animation should start with the appearance of the logo, which begins to move smoothly across the screen along a horizontal or vertical axis. When the logo reaches the edge of the screen, it should bounce off it, changing color, for example, to white.
It is important that the animation is synchronized with a sound effect that imitates the sound of a laser hitting the corner of the screen when the logo bounces off the edge.
To make the animation look as realistic as possible, it is recommended to use CSS properties such as transform, transition, animation, and keyframes. Also, make sure that the animation displays correctly in all modern web browsers.

## Extra task #1* 
Instead of one logo, add two or three logos that move across the screen in different directions and frequencies.

## Extra task #2**

Implement a 3D animation using CSS transitions and perspective. For example, the logos can move along a 3D surface and reflect on mirrored walls.
